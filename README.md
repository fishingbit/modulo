This repository contains Arduino support files for Modulo.

To install:

1. Find your Arduino Sketchbook directory. This is usually Documents/Arduino,
   but may be set to something else in the Arduino preferences.

2. Create the directories [Sketchbook]/libraries and [Sketchbook]/harware if they
   do not already exist.

3. Move the 'Modulo' directory to [Sketchbook]/libraries/Modulo

4. Move the 'ModuloHardware' directory to [Sketchbook]/hardware/ModuloHardware

5. Restart the Arduino app

6. Verify that 'Modulo Controller' appears in the list of boards, and that 'Modulo'
   appears in the list of examples.
